abstract: Quantum networking seeks to enable global entanglement distribution, but terrestrial and free-space channels face severe loss and noise limitations, necessitating quantum repeaters with efficient, long-lived quantum memories (QMs). Space-based architectures, particularly satellite-assisted links, offer a path to intercontinental scales, yet demand QMs compatible with orbital constraints like radiation, power limits, and extended latencies. In this work we propose a multimode quantum memory (MMQM) for Low-Earth Orbit (LEO) repeaters based on the atomic frequency comb (AFC) protocol. Our design integrates a hybrid alkali–noble-gas ensemble in an optical cavity, using alkali atoms for strong photon–matter coupling and noble-gas nuclear spins for minutes-to-hours coherence—without cryogenics. The architecture natively supports temporal and spectral multiplexing, enabling storage of a hundred modes to parallelize probabilistic operations and overcome light-limited round-trip times. Representative link budgets at $h\!\approx\!500$ km with realistic apertures, $\eta_{\text{mem}}\!\gtrsim\!70\%$, and $t_{\text{buffer}}$ of several minutes predict improvements of up to two orders of magnitude in per-pass success probability and instantaneous SKR relative to memoryless dual downlink, with clear scaling in $N$. Our contributions are: (i) a non-cryogenic, space-ready multimode memory; (ii) a systems analysis coupling mode count, storage time, and orbital geometry to achievable rate; and (iii) a near-term implementation roadmap. Together, these results indicate feasibility with current to near-term technology and provide a practical path toward a high-rate, space-enabled quantum internet.
