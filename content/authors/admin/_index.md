## About Me
Connor Casey is a senior at the University of Massachusetts Amherst pursuing a multidisciplinary curriculum in physics, computer science, electrical engineering, mathematics, philosophy, and finance. On the theory side he works with Professor Don Towsley in the ACQuIRe Lab within the NSF Center for Quantum Networks on modeling quantum repeater architectures and quantum error correction for satellite links. On the experimental side he works with Professor Chen Wang in the Superconducting Quantum Information Lab on superconducting circuits, bosonic quantum error correction, microwave control, and cryogenic measurement. His interests center on networking and distributed quantum computation and on building quantum memories and control that scale. He plans to focus on experimental quantum physics in graduate school while continuing to bridge theory and practice on the path to a global quantum internet.
