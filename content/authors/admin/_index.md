## About Me
Connor Casey is a junior at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, where he pursues a multidisciplinary curriculum in physics, computer science, electrical engineering, mathematics, philosophy, and finance. His research interests are centered on networking and distributed quantum computation, with a focus on exploring novel protocols and architectures that can efficiently integrate quantum systems. Under the mentorship of Professors Don Towsley at the Advanced Classical and Quantum Information Research Lab (ACQuIRe)—part of the NSF-funded Center for Quantum Networks (CQN)—he is currently benchmarking QEC-based and entanglement purification satellite repeater chains. In the future, he hopes to continue tackling challenges in quantum networking to help realize a global quantum internet.
