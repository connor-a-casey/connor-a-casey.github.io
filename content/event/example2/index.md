summary: Presenting at the Space-Based Optical and Quantum Communications Session.
abstract: Quantum repeaters, the backbone of long‐distance quantum networks, are limited by the short coherence time of conventional memories.  Discrete time crystals (DTCs)—driven many-body phases that exhibit persistent sub-harmonic oscillations and thereby break discrete temporal symmetry—can shield encoded information from local perturbations, making them compelling candidates for next-generation, decoherence-resistant memories. In this work we introduce a tensor-network framework that models a quantum memory as a discrete time crystal (DTC).  We employ the time-evolving block-decimation (TEBD) algorithm to perform both real- and imaginary-time evolution of a matrix-product-state (MPS) representation, thereby efficiently capturing the large many-body Hilbert space while tracking entanglement growth, sub-harmonic spectral responses, and memory-fidelity metrics over experimentally relevant timescales.  By sweeping the drive strength, interaction range, and disorder, we map the phase diagram, pinpoint regimes that sustain time-crystalline order, and set the stage to model their coherence lifetimes. Our study seeks to understand the practical utility of this novel form of matter in realizing fault-tolerant quantum networks.
