ðŸš€ **New adventure unlocked!** Iâ€™ve officially joined the **Wang Lab**â€”home of the SchrÃ¶dinger-cat qubitâ€”where Iâ€™ll be diving deep into superconducting-circuit devices for quantum information processing.

## What Iâ€™ll be working on

- **Reservoir engineering:** Crafting passive, continuous-wave stabilization schemes that *autonomously* repair single-photon lossâ€”no heavy feedback loops required.
- **Logical-level leverage:** Implementing **bosonic error-correction** codes to turn fragile photons into long-lived logical qubits.  
- **Tunable band-pass Filter:** Engineering a plunger-tuned cavity band-pass filter to clean up the control/readout chain and enable agile frequency routing.  
- **QuTiP-driven design:** Running high-fidelity QuTiP simulations of driven-dissipative Hamiltonians to steer experiments with **fluxonium and transmon qubits**.  

Iâ€™m beyond excited to collaborate with the talented researchers in the Wang Lab and to help build the next generation of fault-tolerant quantum hardware. Stay tuned for updated in the coming months!
