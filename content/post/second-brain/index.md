🚀 **Next stop: Sydney!** Our paper, *Multi-Mode Quantum Memory Architecture for High-Throughput Satellite-Based Quantum Networks*, has been accepted for presentation at the **76th International Astronautical Congress (IAC 2025)** in Australia’s iconic harbour city.
Catch us in the **Space-based Optical and Quantum Communications** session!

## What’s inside?

- **Bandwidth boom:** We show how storing *multiple* spectral, temporal, or spatial photon modes in a single quantum-memory node can boost entanglement-distribution rates by an order of magnitude.

Stay tuned—session details and slide links will drop once the final program is out. **See you Down Under!** 🐨🇦🇺
