ðŸš€ **Weâ€™re heading to Milan!** Our paper, *Advancing Freeâ€‘Space Optical Communication System Architecture: Performance Analysis of Varied Optical Groundâ€‘Station Network Configurations*, has been accepted for presentation at the 75th International Astronautical Congress (IACâ€¯2024).

## Whatâ€™s inside?

- A concise review of the global FSO ecosystem and remaining engineering hurdles.
- Comparative linkâ€‘budget and availability analysis of **portable vs. largeâ€‘aperture** optical ground stations.
- Systemâ€‘level tradeâ€‘offs for scaling LEOâ€‘toâ€‘ground optical constellations.

**Authored by:** Eugene Rotherham, Connor Casey, Eva Fernandezâ€¯Rodriguez *etâ€¯al.*

Stay tunedâ€”weâ€™ll share the presentation schedule and slides once the conference program is finalized. See you in Milan!
