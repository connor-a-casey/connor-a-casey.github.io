‚è≥‚ú® **Next stop: Albuquerque!**  
Our paper, *Time Crystals for Quantum Memories: A Tensor-Network Approach*, has been accepted for presentation at **IEEE Quantum Week ‚Äî QCE 2025** in New Mexico.  
Catch us in the **Quantum Simulation and Many-Body Physics** track!

## What‚Äôs inside?

- **Time-crystalline stability:** We model quantum memories as *discrete time crystals* (DTCs)‚Äîdriven many-body systems whose subharmonic oscillations can passively protect stored information from local perturbations.
- **Tensor-network power:** Using matrix-product-state (MPS) simulations with time-evolving block decimation (TEBD), we map the DTC phase diagram, track subharmonic order, and analyze memory fidelity over experimentally relevant timescales.
- **Noise resilience:** Our simulations show that DTC order can survive moderate environmental decoherence, hinting at a pathway toward robust, passively protected quantum memories.

Stay tuned‚Äîsession details and the poster will be shared once the final program is released. **See you in the Land of Enchantment!** üåµüåå
